/**
 * Extract the MD5 hash code of a stream for use in (simple) deduplication. MD5
 * is no longer considered cryptographically secure, but it's the only hashing
 * function compiled into ffmpeg by default that's wide enough to use as an
 * identifier.
 *
 * The MD5 checksum of the whole file includes tags and whatever other
 * non-audio garbage is in the file, so use ffmpeg to hash only the encoded
 * audio data (note the "encoded" part, which explains this particular set of
 * inscrutable options â€“ other ways of extracting the hash code decode the
 * audio first, which is much slower).
 *
 * Note that an early version of this code used either ffmpeg or libav's
 * avconv, but I quickly learned they produce different hash values (my
 * completely uneducated guess is that libav includes frame headers or Xing /
 * Lame tags). The produced hash codes may or may not be portable between
 * versions of ffmpeg and different architectures. I make no guarantees.
 *
 * Also note that this isn't a fingerprint. I don't care about deduplicating
 * different encodings of the same audio, I just want to know when I've got two
 * identical streams, which may or may not include differing metadata tags.
